          <p>This an example HTML site for an exercise. I'm learning how to create a site.</p>
        <h1>Cities I've lived in:</h1>
          <p>The first city I've lived in for about 14 years. I was a military brat, so we lived near the Army post. The city in OK was my first base after I commisioned in the Air Force. Finally, Colorado Springs is the current city I'm stationed in for work.</p>

        <h1>Cities I want to visit:</h1>
          <p>I really want to visit countries in Asia. I like the culture and the food. I was born in the Philippines so I liked the way of life. I also like the beach, and I have never been to Hawaii so that's why it's on the list.</p>
